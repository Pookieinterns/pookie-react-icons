# Usage

Using **Pookie React Icons** in your project is intuitive. Simply import the icons you need as components.

## Basic Example

```jsx
import { Home, Search, Github } from 'pookie-react-icons';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="layout">
      <Home />
      <Search />
      <Github />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Benefits
- Icons are rendered as **inline SVGs**.
- They inherit the parent's font size and color by default.
- Components are stateless and lightweight.
